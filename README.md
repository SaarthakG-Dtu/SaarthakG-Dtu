## 🌱 About Me

I am a B.Tech student in Mathematics & Computing at Delhi Technological University (DTU) with a strong interest in **Computer Vision, Multimodal AI, and real-world perception systems**.

My focus is on building intelligent systems that can perceive complex environments, fuse multimodal signals, and move toward robust world modelling and reasoning. I am particularly inclined toward research-driven AI with real-world deployment relevance.

## 🚁 Research Exposure

### UAS-DTU | Software Team — DARPA TRIAGE Challenge (2025)

Contributed to a real-time multimodal perception system designed for medical triaging in dynamic, real-world environments.

My work involved:

* Exploring LiDAR and depth-based signal fusion
* Implementing YOLO-based segmentation pipelines
* Dense pixel tracking for motion understanding
* Temporal modelling using LSTM for fine-grained motor activity analysis

This experience shaped my research inclination toward multimodal perception and real-time intelligent systems beyond controlled datasets.
