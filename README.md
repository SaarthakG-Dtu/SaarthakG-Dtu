## 🌱 About Me

I am a B.Tech student in Mathematics & Computing at Delhi Technological University (DTU) with a strong interest in **Computer Vision, Multimodal AI, and real-world perception systems**.

My primary focus lies in building intelligent systems that can perceive complex environments, fuse multimodal signals, and move toward more robust world modelling and reasoning capabilities. I am particularly drawn to research at the intersection of deep learning, perception, and real-world deployment.

## 🚁 Research Exposure

### UAS-DTU | Software Team — DARPA TRIAGE Challenge (2025)

Contributed to the development of a real-time multimodal perception system for medical triaging in a high-stakes, real-world setting.

My work involved exploring perception pipelines that integrate vision and motion signals, with emphasis on:

* LiDAR and depth-based signal fusion
* YOLO-based segmentation for region-level perception
* Dense pixel tracking for motion understanding
* Temporal modelling using LSTM for fine-grained motor activity analysis

This experience significantly shaped my interest in multimodal perception and research-driven AI systems deployed beyond controlled lab environments.
